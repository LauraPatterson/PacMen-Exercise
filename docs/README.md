# Pac-Men Exercise
<img src="PacMan1.png" style="width: 200px; height: 211px;" />
          
## Description
With one left-click of the mouse, Pac-Man moves back and forth across the screen with slight animation by using 4 images. 

### My contribution (Pac-Men.js)
- Wrote the code within function checkPageBounds
- Globally declared pageWidth
- Added setTimeout

## How To Run:
1. Download files locally
2. Make sure all 4 PacMan images are in a folder called images
3. Drag and drop index.html into your browser's address bar
4. Left click Pac-Man and watch him move across your screen

## Roadmap of future improvements:
- [ ] Add multiple pac-men
- [ ] Change pac-man's speed
